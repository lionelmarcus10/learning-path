## Scenario


```

An intelligence agency gave us a zipped file to analyze. They say they obtained it from a suspected terrorist trying to send it to one of its allies. We trust you to uncover the hidden message but do not tell anyone about it. Sshhh ...  
  
**Hint:**  
(**noises** The usage of 'reverse racism' and 'reverse discrimination' arose in direct response to affirmative and race-based policies in the 1970s. Instead of playing the identity politics of "our base" and "their base," we should unite people around ideas and principles.)
