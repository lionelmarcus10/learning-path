## Principes d'énumération

| **PRINCIPES** |
|---|----|
|There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.|
|Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.|
|There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.|

>Another advantage of these principles is that we can see from the practical tasks that we do not lack penetration testing abilities but technical understanding when we suddenly do not know how to proceed because our core task is not to exploit the machines but to find how they can be exploited.**
